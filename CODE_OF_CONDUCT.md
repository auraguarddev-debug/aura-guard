# Code of Conduct

We want Aura Guard to be a welcoming project for everyone.

## Be kind

- Be respectful in issues, pull requests, and discussions.
- Assume good intent. Ask questions before jumping to conclusions.
- Give constructive feedback. Focus on the work, not the person.

## No harassment

Harassment and discriminatory behavior are not acceptable. This includes (but isn’t limited to) comments or behavior related to:

- race, ethnicity, nationality
- gender identity or expression
- sexual orientation
- disability
- religion
- age

## Keep it safe

- Do not post private information (API keys, personal data, etc.).
- If you find a security issue, please follow **SECURITY.md** instead of opening a public issue.

## Enforcement

Project maintainers may remove content and/or restrict participation if this code of conduct is violated.

Thank you for helping keep the community healthy.
