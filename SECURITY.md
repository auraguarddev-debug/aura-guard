# Security Policy

Thanks for helping keep Aura Guard and its users safe.

## Reporting a vulnerability (private)

Please **do not** open a public GitHub issue for security problems.

### Preferred (GitHub)

1) Go to the repo’s **Security** tab
2) Click **Report a vulnerability** (this opens a private Security Advisory)

### Alternative (email)

If you can’t use GitHub advisories, email the maintainer privately:

- Contact: **auraguard.dev@gmail.com**

## What to include

Please include:

- a clear description of the issue
- steps to reproduce
- possible impact
- any suggested fix (optional)

## Response expectations

This is a small project, so responses may not be instant. We will:

1) confirm we received your report
2) investigate and decide on a fix
3) publish a patch release if needed

## Supported versions

Security fixes are released for the latest version on the `main` branch.
